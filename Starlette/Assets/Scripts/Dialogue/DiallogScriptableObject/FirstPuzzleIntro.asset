  - "Moka \\nAlright, back to business. See that panel over there? That\u2019s the
    room\u2019s energy control mechanism\u2014but it\u2019s been scrambled. Every

  - "Moka \\nOur task is simple\u2014reconnect each value with the correct data type.
    The left side shows the variable names and types, and the right side holds the
    values. "
  - "Moka \\nBut here\u2019s the twist... every time you reopen this panel, the values
    on the right are shuffled. You\u2019ll have to memorize and match them all in
