  - Moka \nAloha, crew of this ship, my name is Moka! I am an AI assistant embedded
    in this tablet to help you solve puzzles on the station. I can access data from
    this room and give you the clues you need.
  - Moka \nYou seem confused-let me introduce myself further. I'm an AI system designed
    to help the crew understand the mechanics of each room. Whenever you need help,
    you can count on me!
  - Moka \nI will help you to return to Earth! Actually, I'm also confused about
    what happened. Suddenly everything went dark and the communication system malfunctioned.
    I can't detect the whereabouts of the other crew members, but at least I can
    still help you control the systems on this ship. Let's find a way out together!
