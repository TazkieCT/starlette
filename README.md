# 🌟 Starlette - An Educational Puzzle Game

**Starlette** is an engaging 2D escape room puzzle game that subtly teaches players programming logic through interactive challenges. Inspired by commercial-quality games, Starlette disguises learning in fun mechanics—perfect for players who "accidentally" learn while having fun!

## 🎮 Game Overview

> _"A game you play for fun, but end up learning to code!"_

Starlette places the player inside a mysterious digital lab where the only way out is through solving logic-based puzzles. The catch? Each puzzle represents a fundamental programming concept—like loops, conditionals, variables, and operators—all hidden beneath an intuitive block-based system.
